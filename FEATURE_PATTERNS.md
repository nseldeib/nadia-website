# Feature Patterns

When the feature you're building involves any of the patterns below, **read the linked doc before writing code**. These patterns are designed for this project's Postgres dev environment and upgrade cleanly to production services later.

## Authentication (login, sign-up, user sessions)

**Read:** `AUTH_PATTERNS.md`

Use the cookie + DB auth abstraction in `app/lib/auth.ts`. All consumer code imports from this single file. DO NOT use NextAuth, Clerk, better-auth, Supabase Auth, or any external auth provider during prototyping — they require infrastructure unavailable locally.

**For scenarios:** Include User and Session seed rows so the app's server-side `getSession()` lookup has a row to find. There is no top-level `session` field on `ScenarioDefinition` — see `AUTH_PATTERNS.md` for why the browser cookie still needs to be set manually via the `/login` flow for now.

**Upgrade path:** See `AUTH_UPGRADE.md` — only `app/lib/auth.ts` internals change; consumer code stays the same.

## External Services (payments, email, maps, weather APIs, etc.)

If the user has dev/test credentials (e.g., Stripe test keys):

- Add them to the `env` block of your editor config. Secret values (API keys, tokens) go in `.codeyam/editor.local.json` (gitignored); non-secret defaults can go in `.codeyam/editor.json`. `editor.local.json` is overlaid on top of `editor.json`, so a secret there wins.
- Restart the dev server — the `env` table is applied to the dev-server process, so the values land in `process.env`

If no credentials are available:

- Build with real API calls in the code
- Mock responses per scenario using `mocks.http` with absolute URL keys (e.g. `"POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges"`) in scenario registration (Step 10). There is no separate `externalApis` field — local and external endpoints go in the same `mocks.http` map.

## File Storage / Uploads

For local prototyping, store files in the `public/uploads/` directory and serve them as static assets. Use `fs.writeFile` in API routes. For production, swap to S3/Cloudflare R2/Supabase Storage.

## Images & External Media

Prefer Unsplash (`https://images.unsplash.com/photo-<id>?w=800&q=80`) for realistic seed-data images — semantic relevance matters when scenarios double as visual documentation.

- When a specific Unsplash photo ID returns `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ORB` or 404 during scenario verification, swap **just that photo ID** to a different Unsplash photo on the same subject. Do not bulk-replace the set — the other URLs are almost certainly fine.
- If a scenario needs a guaranteed-available image (e.g., long-lived stored data that can't be re-generated), download the image once into `public/images/` and reference it locally.
- Last resort: a tagged placeholder service (`https://loremflickr.com/<w>/<h>/<tag>`). These return random matches and degrade visual quality; only use when Unsplash is unavailable for the whole subject. Never hand-write loremflickr URLs — always generate them through the `codeyam-editor editor loremflickr-url` helper to use vetted, single-word tags with strict `match=all` and pinned `lock=<n>` parameters.

## Email / Notifications

For prototyping, log emails to the console or write them to a `/api/dev/sent-emails` endpoint that stores in the database. For production, swap to Resend/SendGrid/Postmark.

---

_This list will grow as new patterns are added. Each pattern follows the same principle: build with a simple local implementation, upgrade to a production service later by swapping one file._
